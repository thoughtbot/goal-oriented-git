# Introduction

The first two sections of this book have focused on the basics of using Git.
We've seen many compelling reasons to track our changes with Git, but so far
we've been paddling in the shallows: it's time to go deeper, and explore Git's
powerful branching features.

Branching allows us to explore multiple possible worlds. We can develop our
project in two or more directions, keeping the commits that track those changes
separate from each other, like the branches of a tree spreading out from a
single trunk.

If several of the ideas we try work out, we can merge them back together,
letting Git do the heavy lifting of figuring out how all of the changes we've
made knit back together.

Many of Git's collaborative features are built on the idea of branching: you
work on your branch, I work on mine, and when we're ready we merge our branches
back into one. We'll explore this in more detail the next section.
